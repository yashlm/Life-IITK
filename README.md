This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Firstly install the npm packages:

npm install

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
